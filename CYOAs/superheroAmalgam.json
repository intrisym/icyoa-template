You should be dead, but instead, you're here in the hospital staring at me with that dumb look on your face. This place is not safe for you. You have... changed, and now very dangerous people are after you. I'm going to check outside. I'll be right back, try and get a feel for your new bod, you may need to use it soon.\" "

This was pretty well documented, and it's a suspected several super villains were on their way before I extracted you, so, you're welcome. Besides the obvious differences to your body, you have already noticed, you will also probably develop power in the next several months, as well as new changes to your personality. The CSA won't leave you to suffer on your own, though, we plan to put you in a loving foster family or a job and to provide help and protection, so you can turn into a brave CSA agent or useful vigilante. First, though, we need to find out what power you will develop.
